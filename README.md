# 🌦️ Weather App – Infrastructure with Redis & RabbitMQ (REST APIs)

This repository demonstrates infrastructure-focused patterns using **Redis for caching** and **RabbitMQ for messaging** in .NET REST APIs. These are built around a simplified Weather App use case, showing how infrastructure concerns can be modularized and cleanly integrated.

## 📦 Projects

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `WeatherApp.RestApi.UsingBackgroundService` | Implements a background service for polling weather data at configurable intervals, with optional API-based triggering. |
| `WeatherApp.RestApi.RedisCache` | Implements Redis caching to store and retrieve weather data for optimized performance. |
| `WeatherApp.RestApi.RabbitMQ`   | Implements RabbitMQ-based message queueing to asynchronously publish and process weather updates. |


Each project is **self-contained** and includes its own `.sln` file for independent testing.
